You are given a rectangle of dimensions $N$*$M$ composed of $1\times 1$ squares.
Your job is to count the number of squares inside that rectangle.
The squares we are talking about can have any side length.
For example the number of squares inside a $2$*$3$ rectangle is $8$:
$6$ of side length $1$ and $2$ of side length $2$.

INPUT:
the first and only line of the input contains two integers $N$ and $M$ ($1$<=$N$,$M$<=$1000000$)

OUTPUT:
print a single integer, the answer to the problem
